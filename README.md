# DU-AI-Challenge
## Overview
The DU AI Challenge: DU Arena Season 1 is an intensive 8-hour computer vision competition where participants develop AI models to detect and classify traffic objects in drone-captured aerial images from Bangladesh. Teams will compete to achieve the highest mean Average Precision (mAP) on a dataset featuring 11 object classes including Bangladesh-specific vehicles like CNG auto-rickshaws, legunas, and cycle rickshaws.

## Dataset Overview      
Training Set: 174 high-resolution drone images with YOLO format annotations     
Test Set: 57 images requiring object detection predictions     
Classes: 11 traffic participant categories including cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, pedestrians, and Bangladesh-specific vehicles (CNG, leguna, rickshaw, manual-van)     
Image Resolution: Primarily 4K (3840Ã—2160) aerial captures     
Average Objects per Image: 33 (dense traffic scenes)
